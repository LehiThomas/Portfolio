Hello March!

This week I took on a research role instead of a hands on role. 
I created several new sandboxes, including Socket, AppControl, and JUnit.

In each of these sandboxes I researched the topics and took notes.  I refrained from writing code this week
and instead tried to just focus on the topic itself and tried to understand it. Next week I hope to write code 
for each of these. Another reason was that I am still looking for better sources for a couple topics so that 
I can have a better understanding.

I also created some new uml diagrams. I created a Use Case, Use Case Document and a Sequence diagram for the app that 
my group is working on. 

I have done quick a bit of work this week but most of it has been on the app that we're doing and not these topics.
