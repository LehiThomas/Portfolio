I had a problem when I first started studying Java Beans. 
I couldn't get my head around what exactly it is because I was over thinking it.
I Java Bean takes multiple objects and combines them into 1 object (or bean).
A Java Bean is simply a Java class that does 3 things:

  1. Implements the Serializable interface - To save the state of an object
  2. Exposes its properties via getter/setter methods - To get and set the values of private variables
  3. Has a no-argument constructor - To instantiate the object

Advantages include:
  - The properties, events, and methods of a bean that are exposed to another application can be controlled.
  - A bean may register to receive events from other objects and can generate events that are sent to those other objects.
  - Auxiliary software can be provided to help configure a java bean.
  - The configuration setting of bean can be saved in a persistent storage and restored.
  
So, JavaBeans are usual Java classes which adhere to certain coding conventions. It's a standard.
