Topics:
This week I created one app that combines JSON, HTTP, and threads.
It can be found in the JSON sandbox under JSONexample.
I also created a short document talking abou the differences between Sockets and HTTP connections 
and why you would use Sockets over HTTP.


UMLs:
I have done several UML diagrams for the app my group is working on. 
The first is a Use Case diagram. It shows how the user can interact with the map 
and menu button. The map includes a locator button which shows the user's 
exact location. The menu button includes buildings and activities. By include I mean that 
those individual aspects of the program would not fully function without the included items. 

I also did a sequence diagram which shows how the processes of the app operate with each other 
and the order in which they do so. 
The first is the options task. From the MapsActivity class the showPopup() method is called and grabs the 
popups xml file and returns that as the main menu. 
The next sequence is the buildings. When pressed the onMenuItemClick() methid is tripped and calls the getMenu() 
method. getMenu() grabs the popup2 xml file and sends that all the way back to MapsActivity as the building menu.
The last sequence I have is the activities sequence. This also goes through onMenuItemClick() but goes to getView(). 
getView() sends back the activities view.

The last one I did is a state diagram which shows the state of each interactive interface, whether it's 
enabled or disabled. The group worked on this one together. I did the best I could making this in Visio 
but I also included the image of the original that we did on the whiteboard after one of our group meetings. 

I also took a crack at the Class diagram. I thought it would look more impressive but it turns out the app is a 
lot more simple than I thought it would be. 


Professionalism:
Interacts professionally with the instructor via questions, expositions, and other types of interactions -
    I believe I have done this on numerous occasions such as comments in the group community or emails. 
    I have copied and pasted conversations that show this and put the file in the Portfolio folder.
    
Interacts professionally and helpfully with other teams - 
    Again I have pasted conversations with other students in the Professionalism folder. 
    
Supports the team by teaching and advising them, and performing work outside of team meetings -
    In this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaaJeKMaHmQ) @15:00 I show my group the work that I had done 
    outside of the group meetings on our group app. Previously in the video is me describing what I did. 

Besides the video, the direct evidence of my examples can be found in the ProfessionalismExamples document 
which is just in the portfolio folder by itself.
