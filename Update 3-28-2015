Topics:
This week I created one app that combines JSON, HTTP, and threads.
It can be found in the JSON sandbox under JSONexample.
I also created a short document talking abou the differences between Sockets and HTTP connections 
and why you would use Sockets over HTTP.


UMLs:
I have done several UML diagrams for the app my group is working on. 
The first is a Use Case diagram. It shows how the user can interact with the map 
and menu button. The map includes a locator button which shows the user's 
exact location. The menu button includes buildings and activities. By include I mean that 
those individual aspects of the program would not fully function without the included items. 

I also did a sequence diagram which shows how the processes of the app operate with each other 
and the order in which they do so. 
The first is the options task. From the MapsActivity class the showPopup() method is called and grabs the 
popups xml file and returns that as the main menu. 
The next sequence is the buildings. When pressed the onMenuItemClick() methid is tripped and calls the getMenu() 
method. getMenu() grabs the popup2 xml file and sends that all the way back to MapsActivity as the building menu.
The last sequence I have is the activities sequence. This also goes through onMenuItemClick() but goes to getView(). 
getView() sends back the activities view.

The last one I did is a state diagram which shows the state of each interactive interface, whether it's 
enabled or disabled. The group worked on this one together. I did the best I could making this in Visio 
but I also included the image of the original that we did on the whiteboard after one of our group meetings.
