Understanding Portfolio â€” February 7, 2015

I did another presentation on the MVC that can be found here:

my presentation starts at 20:30.

I also included the entire TR-Movie-Reviews folder in this sandbox. All of this code is mine.
You can visit the actual site at trippyrodeo.com



I also started working on Java Collections.
I have an example that I found online (CollectionsTest)
and one that I started messing with (MyCollections).
There isn't much there yet but I hope to add to it in the future. 


Lastly, I added my own example to the JSON sandbox. This included work that I have done for the universities website.
