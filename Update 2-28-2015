Updates this week:

First, I went and added the things you wanted for Java Collections which was when you use which collection.
I did this through notes (Whentousewhat.txt) and I found an awesome image (whentousewhatpic.png).

I started on HTTP Connection but I didn't get very far. My notes and examples I found are in that sandbox.

Most of my work this week was spent on Java Threads and MultiThreading. 
I took quite a bit of notes from the sources given and I also wrote a bit of code, which can be found
in the Threads1 folder. That folder is a combination of stuff I found online and some I wrote myself.
