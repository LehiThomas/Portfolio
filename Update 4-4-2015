UMLs:
I edited my Use Case Diagram and Use Case Document trying to add more complexity to both.
One of the major changes is that I changed one of the includes to an extend. I did this between the map 
and the locator button. After thinking about it more I felt that it should be extend because the map does 
not rely on the locator button at all but the locator button adds to the overall functionality of the map.

I also added a class diagram that I did for another course. It is in the myApp folder of the UML sandbox and is simply 
called classDiagram.png
