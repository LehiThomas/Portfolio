Use Case Document - BYU Idaho Maps App

The user will have two immediate choices when he first opens up the app, the map or the menu button. 
The map includes a locator button that, when pressed, animates the map and centers over your location. 
Users can also move around manually and zoom in or out with their fingers.

The menu button opens a side menu that has a buildings item and an activities item. 
The activities button changes the view from a map to a list of the activities on campus.
The buildings button will open a list of the buildings on campus that the user can choose and the 
    map will change to that location.
