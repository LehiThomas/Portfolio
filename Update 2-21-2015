As I stated in my weekly reflection I didn't get as much done this week as I would have like to since everyone got sick. 

I did however spend some time with Hibernate.
I realize that this is a big topic that is going to require some more time but I have some notes that I wanted to get up.
These are just notes I took from one of the sources provided. This week I want to look and find some more sources and 
hopefully write some code.

I also wanted to get some UML diagrams up. These are diagrams that I did in the Systems analysis and Design class last semester.

Not a very big week for me but I hope to rebound this coming week and get a lot done.
