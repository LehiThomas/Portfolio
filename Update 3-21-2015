This week I am trying to make up for last week so I've done quite a bit.

First I worked on Threads.
I followed a good tutorial on threading. In that one I used threading to find prime numbers.
This work can be found in the New folder in the threads sandbox.
Then I did a little project of my own. I used threads to complete the FizzBuzz test.
The FizzBuzz is a simple test that asks you to print numbers 1 to 100 and 
for every number that is divisible by 3 print fizz, every number divisible by 5 print buzz and 
if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 print fizzbuzz. 
I created 2 threads to run through this problem. 
This effectively runs through and does its job but the numbers are out of order since sometimes a thread 
will finish and start again before the other thread finishes once. So I put the results into a 
treemap. This sorts them according to the key, which is the number in this case, and then I displayed that map.
I was pretty proud of this program.


I also have an HTTP connection example that I created for my sharing video last week.
I forgot to hand it in last week but it gets the network connection and then pulls 
a website's information from the internet and displays that. I've spent a lot of time this week 
on HTTP connections because I've been trying to parse an RSS feed and that requires being connected.
So I have several examples I can show of getting the HTTP URLconnection. 


After HTTP I moved on to Client/Server Sockets. 
I got a pretty simple program to run. The server socket send out a request and gets a response 
from the client socket saying hello. Eventually the server times out but if there was more 
communication it would stay up. 
Like I said, this is just a simple program but I was pretty happy that I got it working.
