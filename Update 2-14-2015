This week I working on Java Collections and Java Beans.

For Java Collections I have a couple new files in that sandbox. 
I went through a couple different types of lists and sets. 
I also did my sharing video this week on collections.

Java Beans is such a simple topic that I had a hard time finding sources for it that gave any new information.
In that sandbox I have one file that is code I found online of a Java Bean example.
I also have a text file exlpaining what a java bean is.
